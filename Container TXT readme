To run the container, you first need to pull the Github repo to your local file explorer - "git clone https://github.com/LiamRP01/HelloWorld.git"
Then change your current directory to the Github one, wherever that may be stored on your C drive using the "cd" command 

You then need to run "docker build liams_container"
Then you can do "docker run liams_container"
